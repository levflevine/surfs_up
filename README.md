# Surf Up - Advanced Data Storage

## Overview of the analysis

The project delivers data analysis of weather at the Oahu island in Hawaii that is used by a private investor to make a decision about investing into the Surf n' Shake Shop serving surf boards and ice cream.

Specifically, the investor requested the analysis of the temperature data for the months of June and December in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
